# AdventOfCode-2023

... with a bit of a delay 😅.

Still determined to try and do it semi-regularly!

This year, it's the year of the snake 🐍 Python


## Notes

### Day 1

Pretty hard/long for day 1. Good thing I chose to do it in Python.

### Day 2

Parsing was annoying, but the puzzle was simple enough. Easier than day 1 (except parsing).

### Day 3

This one was medium. An appropriate challenge!

### Day 4

Naive solution quite easy, but part 2 takes a few seconds to complete.


### Day 5

Naive solution is very easy and is sufficient for part 1, but part 2 is a more advanced interval optimization problem which I will do sometime later.
EDIT 13.12.2023: Completed part 2! I feel great because after the test case started working, I just blindly put it through the real input and it worked first try! 😎 

### Day 6

Done in about 15 minutes. Was part 2 supposed to be some sort of optimization problem? I didn't change anything from part 1 naive solution and the answer was calculated in about 1 second. 😅

### Day 7

Easy. Just a simple map to keep track of values and then some edge cases for part 2.

### Day 8

Part 1 is easy, part 2 is a bit more tricky, requires cycle detection and then some math which I'm yet to figure out.
