# AdventOfCode-2023

... with a bit of a delay 😅.

Still determined to try and do it semi-regularly!

This year, it's the year of the snake 🐍 Python


## Notes

### Day 1

Pretty hard/long for day 1. Good thing I chose to do it in Python.

### Day 2

Parsing was annoying, but the puzzle was simple enough. Easier than day 1 (except parsing).

### Day 3

This one was medium. An appropriate challenge!
